    <p><strong>GOV.UK Verify is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS). We use your personal data to help you
      to
      transact securely with government services.</strong></p>
    <p>GOV.UK Verify allows you to access <a href="#government-services">government services</a> securely. You use
      GOV.UK
      Verify to pick a <a href="#certified-company">certified company</a> which verifies your identity. Once your
      identity
      has been verified, the certified company passes the verified information back to GOV.UK Verify, which sends this
      information to the government service you are trying to access.</p>
    <p>This privacy notice explains what information we might collect, how it’s used, how it’s protected and how you can
      find out about it.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="#privacy-policies-of-certified-companies-and-government-departments">Privacy policies
      of certified companies and government departments</h2>
    <p>The certified companies have their own privacy policies that apply to their handling of your personal data as
      part
      of the identity verification process. Likewise, the government services have their own privacy policies that apply
      to their handling of your personal data when you use their services.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="#how-we-use-information">How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use personal data and other information to help you to transact securely with government services. This may
      include:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet list">
      <li>Passing information about selections you made on the <a href="#the-gov-uk-verify-hub">GOV.UK Verify Hub</a> to
        certified companies. This helps certified companies to guide you through the process, making your verification
        process simpler and faster.
      </li>
      <li>At your request, your certified company will send the verified data about you (your name, address and date of
        birth along with your gender if you choose to provide it) to the GOV.UK Verify Hub, and the Hub will send it to
        the government service that you want to access. The certified company you use won’t know which government
        service
        has requested this information. Likewise, the government service will not know which certified company you have
        chosen.
      </li>
      <li>Providing a <a href="#document-checking-service">Document Checking Service (DCS)</a> to certified companies,
        that allows them to check the validity of your UK passport or driving licence with HM Passport Office (HMPO) and
        the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The data that HMPO and DVLA hold about you is not shared with the
        certified companies by DCS. The certified companies provide DCS with the information you have given about your
        driving licence or passport, and receive a simple yes/no answer whether that document is valid or not.
      </li>
      <li>Providing user support when you request it to solve problems you have experienced and collect feedback to
        develop services. With your consent, user support may ask for further information from you, or pass your
        information to a certified company or government service, in order to solve your problem.
      </li>
      <li>Monitoring and reporting how the service works and how it’s used.</li>
      <li>Forecasting volumes for e.g. resourcing purposes and creating reports for billing.</li>
      <li>Helping to prevent fraud in government services and detecting identity fraud when verifying identities.</li>
      <li>Improving your experience of GOV.UK Verify and developing the service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="#what-information-we-process">What information we process</h2>
    <p>We process information about you when you use GOV.UK Verify. This may include:</p>
    <ul class="list-bullet list">
      <li>Answers you provide in the GOV.UK Verify Hub in response to specific questions to help you select a certified
        company, for example whether you’re over a certain age or which documents you have. We do not attempt to
        identify
        you from these.
      </li>
      <li>We may, at your request, forward personal data from your chosen certified company to the government service
        that
        you wish to access. The personal data, known as the Matching Data Set, is provided by you to the certified
        company, and includes present (and optionally previous) name, address, date of birth and optionally gender. This
        Matching Data Set is not stored in the GOV.UK Verify Hub once it it has been passed to the government service,
        nor
        is it monitored.
      </li>
      <li>We also forward the level of assurance, the date and time, an identifier that is used to help in the
        <a href="#matching-a-government-service">matching process</a> and some anonymous identifiers that are used to
        manage the integrity of the authentication session. These are stored for monitoring and reporting purposes.
      </li>
      <li>Questions or feedback you send to user support, including your name and email address, details of your query,
        and actions we have taken to assist.
      </li>
      <li>We may also collect the <a href="#ip-address">IP address</a>,
        <a href="#device-fingerprinting">device fingerprint</a> and details of what device and which version of web
        browser was used to access the service. This data is used for monitoring and reporting and fraud prevention
        purposes, and we do not attempt to identify you from it.
      </li>
      <li>We may collect anonymous data about what government service required the user to authenticate, the certified
        company chosen, whether the certified company was able to verify the user, whether matching was successful at
        the
        government service, and what pages were visited in the GOV.UK Verify Hub. This information is used anonymously
        and
        we don’t attempt to identify you from it, except when you give your contact details to user support.
