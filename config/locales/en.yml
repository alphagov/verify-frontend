        <p>There won’t be any effect on your credit score.</p>
        <p>More than one certified company means you choose who verifies your identity, and it means the system overall is stronger.</p>

        <p>You can then access other government services in less than 1 minute wherever you see the GOV.UK Verify logo.</p>
      content_loa1_html: |
        <p>Verifying your identity takes about 5 minutes to complete.</p>

      heading: Finding the right company to verify you
      content_html: |
        <p>Certified companies have built new, secure systems to verify identities. These systems work by checking:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet list">
        <li>your identity documents are valid</li>
        <li>it’s you providing your details, and not someone pretending to be you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, each company uses different methods for each of these steps.</p>
        <p>So we’ll now ask you some questions to check which companies can verify you. We’ll then send you to the website of the company you choose.</p>
