      explanation1: To verify an identity, these companies access credit records and ask you to confirm this information. Most people living outside the UK have a limited activity history on their UK credit record, so companies might not be able to check your identity in this way.
      explanation2: Your ‘activity history’ includes how often you use your bank or credit accounts, and if you open accounts such as a mortgage, overdraft or loan.

      try_to_verify: I’d like to try to verify my identity using GOV.UK Verify
      explanation: To verify an identity, these companies access credit records and ask you to confirm this information. Most young people and newcomers to the UK have a limited credit history, so some companies might not be able to check their identity in this way.
      what_youll_need: What you’ll need on your credit record
