      explanation1: To verify an identity, these companies access credit records and ask you to confirm this information. Most people living outside the UK have a limited activity history on their UK credit record, so companies might not be able to check your identity in this way.

      explanation: To verify an identity, these companies access credit records and ask you to confirm this information. Most young people and newcomers to the UK have a limited credit history, so some companies might not be able to check their identity in this way.
